I have been trying to make an app to track my grades for the university and as a horrible experience. It's very chaotic and also "non beautiful" it's absolute garbage. I did Object Oriented Programming before, and I remember enjoying it.
My hyphotesis says that "Object Oriente Programing, will be easier to follow and also to read because it will be less simbols and more words or sentences. My objective here is to be able to read my code without the desire of erasing it and quitmy carrer. 
If I'm lucky, I will not drop collage, and how knows? maybe... I'll become software boy. 
Well, I'll put my hands on that project, bye bye.
