I feel dumb, insanely dumb, like an idiot. Shit, I'm feeling sad and angry. I don't know what am I doing with my life. 
I don't like to see how my focus is this shitty, and not only my concentration, but my presence on my own life. I now that complaining is just a way to throw away everything until all the shit comes back. 
I have been putting myself into discomfort to make progress on my carrer mainly, but it hurt's in my heart. All what I'm doing is worth it? Is real that if I do this things something good will happen later? Why am I getting worst at everything? why am I this tired if I slept 8 hours, I eat healty and also I'm working on my social relations? Everything does not look good.
I don't want to fall down, I know is "unusefull bullshit". I just want maybe some... "magic"? some beauty. I could surely make life better. But it's scary to regret. I don't know why am I looking for so much. I'm tired and I woke up 6 hours ago. Something really need to change. 
I truly believe that this is because I do not focus enough on enjoying what I'm doing. I know coding could be fun, but I'm rushing all my way to "the top". 
Is it worth? I still belive that it's worth it to be really good at this art. I truly believe that this could be "my thing", I just need to enjoy it more and also complain less that now.
What should I do now? keep learning new content? create another app?
the second option sounds better than the first one. I'm sick of learning without creating (really sick) I do belive that creating I could find myself and be happier.
I'm going to work on making this more fun.
