I read that, to succed financialy, I need to give the best outcome and use the best things around, and if I don't to that, I'll be increasing my chances to fail.  So I am going to learn about Artificial Intelligence. That's all. I don't know how to, this is my next step. Another question would be: how could I earn money by this? I honestly know shit about it. From now. I'll give my attention to be good at tech, and exploring all what I can explore.
