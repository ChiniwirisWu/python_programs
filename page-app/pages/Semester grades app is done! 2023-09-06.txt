This program was disgusting to do. I don't know if I am the issue here. Surely I'm not having my best days. Deep inside I want to enjoy this. Building things always have been triggering feelings inside me. Probably I'm not giving my 100% on this. WHY!? YOU BITCH, DO WHAT YOU WANT TO!
It's funny, I didn't like my code. Is honestly bs. It was confusing and I had to go back and forward to read it, and I don't thing that I want that. I would like to learn some sort of framework, or base to build on. 
During this development I got a good thought: "It's better to focus on making this work instead of make the best code". Maybe that's the best perspective that I can take in order to make a good experience.
After all. I did 3 versions of this app, I hate it, I wanted to give up, and I kept going until I ended it. It's a good acomplishment. Good Job myself!
